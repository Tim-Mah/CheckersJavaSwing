# CheckersJavaSwing
2 player Checkers implemented using JavaSwing

**Rules:**

Pieces move diagonally to adjacent squares. A player may capture if they can leap diagonally over another player (skipping one space exactly). If a player has a piece that can capture, it must capture.


This was made for my grade 12 software final, where we had to create something using the JavaSwing api. Overall development time was aprox. 2 weeks.
