# CheckersJavaSwing
2 player Checkers implemented using JavaSwing, and Video Demo/Code Explanation

**Rules:**

Pieces move diagonally to adjacent squares. A player may capture if they can leap diagonally over another player (skipping one space exactly). If a player has a piece that can capture, it must capture. A player can click a piece to see its possible moves.


This was made for my grade 12 software final, where we had to create something using the JavaSwing api. Overall development time was aprox. 2 weeks.
